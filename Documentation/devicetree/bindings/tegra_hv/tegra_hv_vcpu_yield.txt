* Tegra Hypervisor VCPU Yield(tegra-hv-vcpu-yield)

Provides support for high priority Linux VM to yield Virtual CPU to a low
priority VM.
Linux VM which is of higher priority and sharing a Physical CPU with a lower
priority VM can yield the CPU(yield Virtual CPU corresponding to the Physical
CPU where the low priority VM runs) for a specific timeout period so that the
low priority VM can make progress.
ioctl is used to trigger the Virtual CPU yield with specific duration for the
yield.
ivc is used by low priority VM to notify the Linux VM that it is done using
CPU before the specified yield timeout expires.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nvidia,tegra-hv-vcpu-yield".
- low_prio_vmid: list of low priority VM id's for which CPU need to be yielded
- yield_vcpu: Virtual CPU core corresponding to each of the low priority VM in
		low_prio_vmid that is shared with Linux VM
- ivc: IVC channel corresponding to each of the low priority VM in low_prio_vmid
		that is used by low priority VM to notify Linux VM that it is
		done using the CPU


Example:
	tegra_hv_vcpu_yield {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra-hv-vcpu-yield";
		yield_vcpu = <2>;
		low_prio_vmid = <2>;
		ivc = <10>;
		status = "okay";
	};
