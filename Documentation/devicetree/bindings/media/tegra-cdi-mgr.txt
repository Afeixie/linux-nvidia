NVIDIA tegra cdi-mgr driver

This file documents the properties used by the cdi-mgr driver in the Tegra
Platform.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nvidia,cdi-mgr"
- i2c-bus: Should contain the I2C bus number that the device is attached to the
  Tegra for controlling the CDI.
- csi-port: Should contain the NVCSI port that the device is attached to the
  Tegra for image streaming.

Optional properties:
- pwdn-gpios: Should contain the list for gpios to control power in order of
  aggregator and camera instances.
- pwr-items: Map power items to the GPIO item specified in the pwdn-gpios list,
  starting from 0. For example, pwr-item 0 is for the deserializer, while
  pwr-item 1, 2, 3, 4 are for links 0, 1, 2, 3
- default-power-on: If this property is used, while probing the device,
  pwdn-gpios are powered on.
- runtime-pwrctrl-off: If this property is present, power control GPIOs retain
  the same status and are never changed.
- interrupt-parent: Should contain interrupt parent for GPIO interrupt.
- interrupts: Should contain the GPIO number that is connected to status pin in
  the CDI device.
- pwms: PWM property to point to the PWM chip, chip-relative PWM number and
  period in nanoseconds.

The pwr_ctrl node describes the methods control deserializer and camera module
power.

Optional properties:
- deserializer-pwr-gpio: The deserializer power is controlled by GPIO.
- cam-pwr-max20087: The external MAX20087 IC is used to control camera module
  link power, accessed over I2C.
- power_port: The GPIO expander port that controls deserializer power. Required
  if the tca9539 node is present.

Optional tca9539 node required properties:
- i2c-bus: Should contain the I2C bus number that the device is attached to the
  Tegra to.
- addr: The 7-bit I2C device address.
- reg_len: The register length, should be set to 8 bits.
- dat_len: The data length, should be set to 8 bits.

Optional max20087 node required properties:
- i2c-bus: Should contain the I2C bus number that the device is attached to the
  Tegra to.
- addr: The 7-bit I2C device address.
- reg_len: The register length, should be set to 8 bits.
- dat_len: The data length, should be set to 8 bits.
- links: Vector of camera module to power link control mappings.

		dat_len = <8>;   /* 8 bit data length */
		des_i2c_port = <0>; /* I2C port number of the deserializer */
		/* des_tx_port = <0>;*/ /* CSI Tx port number. Define des_tx_port only if the dedicated output Tx port is required */
		dphy_rate_x2 = <2500000>; /* Data rate in DPHY x2. Unit size is kbps */
		dphy_rate_x4 = <2500000>; /* Data rate in DPHY x4. Unit size is kbps */

		cphy_rate_x4 = <1700000>; /* Data rate in CPHY x4. Unit size is ksps */
	};

	pwr_ctrl {
		power_port = <0>;
		deserializer-pwr-gpio; /* The deserializer's power is controlled by GPIO */
		cam-pwr-max20087; /* MAX20087 for the camera's power is controlled by I2C */
