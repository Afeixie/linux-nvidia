NVIDIA tegra cdi-tsc driver

This file documents the properties used by the cdi-tsc driver in the Tegra Platform.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nvidia,tegra234-cdi-tsc"

Generators describe discrete Tegra TSC signal outputs, enumerated as generator@<addr>.

Required properties:
- freq_hz: Frequency of the signal in Hertz.
- duty_cycle: Percentage duty cycle of the signal, 0 to 100.
- offset_ms: Offset to shift the signal in milliseconds.

Example:
tsc_sig_gen@c6a0000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra234-cdi-tsc";
	ranges = <0x0 0x0 0xc6a0000 0x10000>;
	reg = <0x0 0xc6a0000 0x0 0x18>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	status = "okay";

	generator@380 {
		reg = <0x380 0x80>;
		freq_hz = <30>;
		duty_cycle = <25>;
		offset_ms = <0>;
		status = "okay";
};
